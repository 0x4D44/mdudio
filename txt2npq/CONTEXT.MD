# Context for txt2npq and npq2txt End-to-End Test

## Current Goal
The primary goal is to get the end-to-end test for `txt2npq` working. This test involves converting an `.npq` file to text using `npq2txt`, and then converting that text back to an `.npq` file using `txt2npq`, finally comparing the original and newly created `.npq` files.

## Current Problem
The end-to-end test is currently failing. The `npq2txt` command, when executed within the test, returns an `UnexpectedEof` error. This indicates that the `.npq` file being generated by the test (for `npq2txt` to process) is not in the format that `npq2txt` expects.

## Next Steps After Restart
1.  **Read `npq2txt` Source:** Once restarted from `c:\language\mdudio`, I will read the source code of `npq2txt` (specifically `c:\language\mdudio\npq2txt\src\main.rs`) to understand its expected `.npq` file format.
2.  **Fix Test File Generation:** I will then modify the `tests/end_to_end.rs` file within the `txt2npq` project (`c:\language\mdudio\txt2npq\tests\end_to_end.rs`) to ensure the `.npq` file it generates for the test is valid according to `npq2txt`'s expectations.
3.  **Rerun Test:** Finally, I will run the end-to-end test again.
